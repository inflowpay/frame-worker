## Description

When starting a small or medium sized business, people that are in frontier markets like Middle East, Latin America or Asia struggles to receive payments online, more especially on cross border micro-payment. Inflow redefines that by allowing those businesses to receive payments from anywhere leveraging stablecoins and without KYC on their payers.

Our project uses Warpcast as a clear example, where now *everyone* that has an onchain social media account *can receive money onchain* even if their followers/Clients are not web3 native.
